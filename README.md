# ardu-report

[![Travis CI](https://img.shields.io/travis/zwischenloesung/ardu-report.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/zwischenloesung/ardu-report)

Python library and CLI to report back the sensor data from our arduino(s).

## Dependencies, Requirements

 * Unix/Linux
 * Python 2.7
  * see requrements.txt

## Basic Idea

For now we have one arduino reporting sensor values back over the serial line.
On the other end there is a raspberry pi collecting the data. The data is then processed and either just printed to the console or a file, or sent over mobile or wired/wireless network to, e.g., a webserver..

If more than one arduino are connected. For each one of them the data processing can be configured individually.

## Use it for Your Project?

I am rewriting the input parser to accept any JSON schema following
the meta schema to control the object index names. As it really only
needs some sort of identifier and a value, there should not be too
many obstacles to use it for your project too. See the 'schema'
folder for details. The 'example' folder contains JSON file that
validates against the schema and the tests/test\_json.py has
a test run for both the input.json against the schema and the
schema against the meta-schema..


## Example Data for Python Processing

### INPUT: JSON from the arduino over the serial line

  [
    {"id":"light_value","value":"777"},
    {"id":"box_temperature","unit":"°C","value":"22.19"},
    {"id":"env_temperature","unit":"°C","value":"20.00"},
    {"id":"env_humidity","unit":"%","value":"71.00"},
    {"id":"env_heat_index","value":"19.91"},
    {"id":"water_level","threshold":"600","value":"0"},
    {"id":"water_distance","unit":"m","value":"0.92"}
  ]

### OUTPUT: Target JSON from the raspberry pi for the use in e.g. a web app

  [
    {"id":"light_value","value":"777", "time"="2017-09-20T21:29:42"},
    {"id":"light_value","value":"777", "time"="2017-09-20T21:39:51"},
    {"id":"light_value","value":"777", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"},
    {"id":"box_temperature","unit":"°C","value":"22.19", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"},
    {"id":"env_temperature","unit":"°C","value":"20.00", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"},
    {"id":"env_humidity","unit":"%","value":"71.00", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"},
    {"id":"env_heat_index","value":"19.91", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"},
    {"id":"water_level","threshold":"600","value":"0", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"},
    {"id":"water_distance","unit":"m","value":"0.92", "time"="2017-09-20T21:49:49"}
  ]
